Plan of attack on HippoCA3
[] Read Brandalise
[+] Read Stew proposal
[] Re-read noise paper, see how important are parameters for SWR generation
  [] Is any amount of release over a certain threshold enough?
  [] If not, must we think of a feedback mechanism in the model that would control if too much is released? The amount/frequency to be released by astrocyte would depend on the amount/frequency released by pre-synaptic neuron.
[] Summarize capabilities of currently existing codes
[] Extract data again from all papers:
  [] Stew's, big book, Guzman appendix, noise paper appendix
[] Pose the question directly
  - How are simulations useful to our understanding of the brain? How are they compatible with experiments?
