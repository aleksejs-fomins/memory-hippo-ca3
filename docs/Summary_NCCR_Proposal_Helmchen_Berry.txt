Hypothesis: Astrocytes trigger Sharp Wave Ripples (SWR) by synchronously releasing glutamate. Thus astrocyte network synchronously activates prior to SWR.

Stew will do:
1) Check under what conditions glutamate is released. Monitor glutamate levels and astrocyte activation levels and correlate in time with SWR
2) Check if astrocyte-astrocyte communication important by inhibiting it
3) Check effects of inhibiting/enhancing astrocytic functions on SWR generation and memory consolidation during tasks for wake mice.

Implications on modeling:
1) Stew should be able to provide constants, such as
  * speed of astrocyte network activation
  * quantity and frequency of glutamate release
