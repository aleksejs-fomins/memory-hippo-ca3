Questions For Andreea:

Performance
    * Why Hamming distance so small for criticality? If 1 flip in source results in ~1 flip in target, the system is effectively decoupled.
    * Why no obvious difference for regimes (T=0..10000, T=10000..20000, T>20000) ?

Assumptions:
    * Only EXC neurons without input have intrinsic plasticity
    * Only EXC->EXC weights will have synaptic plasticity
    * Input letters presented only for one frame
    * Separate neurons per letter - no binary code



If the thresholds are only increased when correct letter appears, and decreased the rest of the time, doesn't that mean that all the thresholds will drop to 0 sooner or later?
